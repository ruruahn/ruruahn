✨ Hello! I'm Ru ✨
🙋🏻‍♀️ Born in South Korea 🇰🇷 / Living in Sweden 🇸🇪

- 👉🏻 A Short Story into Full Stack Developer Life: I graduated university with Linguistics degree and landed a people management job in Stockholm, at Sweden's biggest independent micro-roasters. After two years of enjoying management and using soft-skills at my job, I started to feel a real thirst towards a new profession that I can challenge myself with, and most importantly where I can relate my passion and interest for Linguistics to. I took the chance of Web developer bootcamp at Technigo and soon discovered my passion for analysing and rearranging project's code with 'eyes for grammar'! I am thoroghly enjoying my transition journey from 2 years of working in service & people management into a developer industry!

- ✍🏻 I am a React lover! My top 3 favourite stack has to be React Native, Styled Component and CSS. 💅
- 🤭 Guilty pleasure in coding: I often spend way too much time on CSS when I code because they are so undeniably fun and I feel so powerful when I am making visible changes right away. With ios simulator, Styled component and all those stunning css inspiration sources.... I could easily spend all day, and I need to smack my head a bit to speed up!
- 👩‍💻 Training at Technigo Coding bootcamp - Fall 2021 and I'm currently working as a staff manager at Johan&Nyström 💚
- 👩🏻‍💻I got a Bachelor in Linguistics & Literature with a focus on Discourse Analysis and American Naturalism
- 🫀I'm a career changer: Worked for 2+ years in the Service & People management industry before going into tech 👩‍🍳💪
- 💕I enjoy : chatting with my older sister, scrabble game all day, taking good photos of friends, writing journal, remote bookclub from university
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can speak four languages, I've won essay awards 3 times in my life and I recently developed a kiwi allergy!
